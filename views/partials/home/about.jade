                p Hi! Itâ€™s a pleasure to share a little bit of my story with you!
                p During my university life in Brazil I travelled to Vancouver and was there that I bought my first DSLR camera. I was almost finishing my chemistry studies when I started to play with that. Years later after my graduation, I decided to go deep and beyond with my camera: I started to study photography by myself after my job; then I realized what I could do through the lens and I also learnt that photography is not about the camera or how many lenses you have, is all about the look of whom is recording the moment.
                p In 2015 was a challenge year for me because I decided to quit my chemistry job and leave all my family and friends to go further with photography. I came to Toronto to learn, share and live photography full time.
                p All my photographs I make with love, with passion. I completely involve myself when I am shooting and the result is a collection of amazing images that will live for generations.
